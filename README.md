## BlogSpot 

In order to complete an asigment of my KPS 514 lesson, I was asked to create a blog on Github following the above instructions from this website *http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ 


## Motivation

This project will be my blog in the future to add content of my work as photographer and video editor. 

## Installation

First think you need to do it's to create the *index.html* and there you add the structure of your html code. 



## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License

A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
