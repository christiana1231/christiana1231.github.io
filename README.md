## BlogSpot 

In order to complete an asigment of my KPS 514 lesson, I was asked to create a blog on Github following the above instructions from this website *http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ 

<a href="http://christiana1231.github.io/">Blogspot</a> 



## Motivation

This project will be my blog in the future to add content of my work as photographer and video editor. 

## Installation

First think you need to do it's to create the *index.html* and there you add the structure of your html code. 

## License
